## About Me 🚀
🎓 I’m an **Open-Source enthusiast** & a first year student pursuing my Bachelors in electronics and communications engineering. </br>
👨‍💻  I am passionate about web-development (both front-end and back-end) and still learning and exploring new languages/fields. </br>
🌱 Currently in my exploration stage, highly ambitious, and a real hard-worker for something of my interest.
